-------Cap1 ------
------------------
It is possible to compile this program like:
    gcc -o program main.c calculadora.c salida.c 

But this way is not optimized because it will take time to recompile everything, althoug it has been
only a little change. The proper way to do it is to generate the object file or .o file to maintein it if the 
c code that generates it has not been changed so it is not necessary to recompile it.

There are phony rules than let us execute things without create them. clean for example.
You can write the make target you want. if you dont specify the target it will execute the first rule in the Makefile.
If a rule has as dependencies other rules, it will be executed before.
