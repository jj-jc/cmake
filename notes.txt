It is possible to compile this program like:
    gcc -o program main.c calculadora.c salida.c 

But this way is not optimized because it will take time to recompile everything, althoug it has been
only a little change. The proper way to do it is to generate the object file or .o file to maintein it if the 
c code that generates it has not been changed so it is not necessary to recompile it.
